<p class="bio">Hello! My name is Abigail Dow and I'm from San Diego. I will graduate with a Bachelor's of Arts in English with a cluster in Professional Writing and Editing from Brigham Young University Idaho in April 2024. I have experience with editing and technical writing, as well as a background in all Adobe Programs. I enjoy designing projects and writing techincal content. I adore traveling and this summer I had the oppurtunity to attend the British Literary Tour with BYUI. One other thing that I love is animals. I love my cat, Willow, who is a Siamese Ragdoll mix. Over the summers, when I am not attending school, I have a part time job at the San Diego Zoo. My ideal job would be working as an editor or technical writer at a Natural History Museum or Zoo. My current goal is to graduate from BYUI with a job lined up in San Diego. </p>
