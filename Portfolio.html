<h3 class="h3">Indesign</h3>
<a class="listitems" href="../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/Horror Movie Calendar Complete (1).pdf" target="_blank">Horror Movie Calendar</a>
<p> One skill that I have developed during my time at BYUI is being comfortable with the Adobe suite. One example of this is Indesign. I have been using Indesign since I was in High School, so I am very comfortable and familiar with it. For this project, my group wanted to create a horror movie calendar for the month of October to count down to Halloween. We corroborated on the project and worked hard to make it cohesive. We designed our color pallete using Adobecolors. We also used ChatGPT to help us come up with many of our movie ideas. </p>

<p>Photoshop is one tool that I didn't know very well before this class, so I was glad that I had the oppurtunity to work develop my skills. For this project, I wanted to create a campaign of posters to promote Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. I used images of her differnt outfits to make collages of her different albums/eras. I also used the fonts for her different albums to highlight when she says the album name in a lyric. The idea behind them was to raise awareness, and they would theoretically be poster on her social media to pomrote the movie and tour. </p>
<h3 class="h3"> Illustrator </h3>

	<li class="listitems"><a href="icon final.pdf" target="_blank">Animal Icons</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Illustrator is one program that I am not a fan of. I find it difficult to use and not that useful in the grand scheme of things. However, I am still glad that I was able to futher develop my skills. For this project, I was creating logos for a fictional restruant in Rexburg that caters to people with dietary needs or allergies. I used coolors to create my color pallete. I also created a social media strategy for this restaurant campaign. The idea behind these icons was to make the restaurant heavenly because it is a place where people don't have to worry about their allergies. I also inlcluded icons I made in my Visual Media course where I created several animal icons. </p>
<h3 class="h3"> Using AI </h3>
<a class="listitems" href="../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/Project 1 Final Draft (1).pdf" target="_blank">AI Project</a>
<p>I think that this was perhaps the most intersting project of the semester. I had never used AI before, so it was very weird to have to use it in a class. However, I am glad I did because it has been very helpful for many projects I have created. I learned a lot in this project, especially how to get AI to give me specific answers to questions. For this project, our group created a brochure for a fictional animal shelter. We used ChatGPT to create the bios for the cats as well as most of the information about the organization. We used knightcafe and adobefirefly to generate the images.  </p>
<h3 class="h3">Writing Samples</h3>
<a  class="listitems" href="../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/Research Article Final Draft.pdf">Research Article </a>
<p>One writing sample that I have included is the research article that I wrote about how Native American literature affects people's perceptions of the envrionemnt. I used several different peer reviewed sources to support my claim as well as an interview with a member of the Hopi Tribe in Northern Arizona. </p>
